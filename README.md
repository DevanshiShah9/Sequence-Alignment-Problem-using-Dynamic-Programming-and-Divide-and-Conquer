# Sequence Alignment Problem using Dynamic Programming and Divide and Conquer

## Overview

This was a final project for USC CSCI 570 -  Analysis of Algorithms course in collaboration with peers. The primary focus was on developing and comparing basic Dynamic Programming solutions and memory-efficient versions to find the optimal alignment between two strings.

## Algorithm Description

The project considered two strings, X and Y, and defined similarity based on finding the optimal alignment between them. The alignment was determined by gap penalties and mismatch costs, seeking the alignment with minimum cost.

## Input String Generator

The program took input from a text file (`input.txt`). It included information to generate two strings from the original base strings, ensuring lengths based on provided indices.

## Goals

### Part A: Basic Dynamic Programming Solution
### Part B: Memory-Efficient Solution

### Visualization

- Plotted CPU time vs problem size for both solutions.
- Plotted Memory usage vs problem size for both solutions.

## Usage

- Provided base strings and necessary gap/mismatch penalties in `input.txt`.
- Ran the program to generate alignments and recorded performance metrics in `output.txt`.
- Compared basic and memory-efficient solutions through visualization.
